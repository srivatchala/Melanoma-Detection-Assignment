# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection

## Abstract

In the realm of cancer, there exist over 200 distinct forms, with melanoma standing out as the most lethal type of skin cancer among them. The diagnostic protocol for melanoma typically initiates with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Early detection of melanoma skin cancer is pivotal, as it significantly enhances the chances of successful treatment. The initial step in diagnosing melanoma skin cancer involves visually inspecting the affected area of the skin. Dermatologists capture dermatoscopic images of the skin lesions using high-speed cameras, which yield diagnostic accuracies ranging from 65% to 80% for melanoma without supplementary technical assistance. Through further visual assessment by oncologists and dermatoscopic image analysis, the overall predictive accuracy of melanoma diagnosis can be elevated to 75% to 84%. The objective of the project is to construct an automated classification system leveraging image processing techniques to classify skin cancer based on images of skin lesions.

## Problem statement

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information

The dataset comprises 2357 images depicting malignant and benign oncological conditions, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). These images were categorized based on the classification provided by ISIC, with each subset containing an equal number of images.


In order to address the challenge of class imbalance, the Augmentor Python package (https://augmentor.readthedocs.io/en/master/) was employed to augment the dataset. This involved generating additional samples for all classes, ensuring that none of the classes had insufficient representation.


## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - version 3.11.4
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - version 3.7.1
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - version 1.24.3
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - version 1.5.3
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - version 0.12.2
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - version 2.15.0


## Conclusions

The ultimate model showcases well-balanced performance, displaying no signs of underfitting or overfitting.

The implementation of class rebalancing has notably enhanced the model's performance across both training and validation datasets.

Following 37 epochs, the final model attains an accuracy of 84% on the training set and approximately 79% on the validation set.

The narrow divergence between training and validation accuracies underscores the robust generalization capability of the final CNN model.

The addition of batch normalization failed to enhance both training and validation accuracy.
